# 🌬️🎸 Respiratory — AI in Perfect Rhythm (Google AI Studio)

> **Respiratory** is my core AI application built using **Google AI Studio (Gemini)**.  
Think of it like a **guitar 🎸** — where prompts are strings, tuning is prompt engineering, and responses are pure intelligence in rhythm.

## 🎼 The Guitar Metaphor (How Respiratory Thinks)

Just like a guitar creates music:

🎵 **Strings** → Prompts (text, files, images)  
🎚️ **Tuning Pegs** → Prompt Engineering  
🎸 **Sound Output** → AI Responses  
🧠 **Guitarist** → Google AI Studio (Gemini Model)

If tuning is right, the output resonates perfectly ✨
